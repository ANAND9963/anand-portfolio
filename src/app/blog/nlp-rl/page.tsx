            <h1>NLP Meets Reinforcement Learning</h1>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">Published on Nov 20, 2024</p>

            <p>
                Natural Language Processing (NLP) has evolved rapidly with deep learning, but
                adding <strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</strong> has taken it to the next
                level. I’ve explored this space both academically and in projects, applying
                RL concepts to improve model alignment and interactive dialogue systems.
            </p>

            <h2>Why RL in NLP?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Traditional supervised training doesn’t capture user preferences.</li>
                <li>RL allows models to optimize responses for rewards (like human feedback).</li>
                <li>Used heavily in RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) for LLMs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Case Studies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chatbots:</strong> Optimizing conversational agents to improve response
                    helpfulness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Summarization:</strong> Rewarding models for concise yet complete summaries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dialogue alignment:</strong> Preventing toxic or biased outputs with
                    human feedback loops.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Teaching Assistant Work</h2>
            <p>
                As a <strong>Teaching Assistant at the University of Bridgeport</strong>, I guided
                students through practical applications of NLP and RL. We explored how models
                like GPT are fine-tuned using RLHF to align with user intent.
            </p>

            <h2>Future Potential</h2>
            <p>
                Combining RL and NLP can revolutionize AI assistants — making them more{" "}
                <em>adaptive, safe, and user-friendly</em>. From dynamic tutoring systems to
                enterprise AI copilots, the applications are endless.
